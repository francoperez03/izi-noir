# Noir Circuits Development Skill

## Overview

This skill provides expertise in Noir zero-knowledge circuit development for privacy-preserving applications on Solana.

## Capabilities

- Circuit design and architecture
- Proof generation optimization
- Verification integration with Solana
- Privacy pattern implementation

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Designing privacy-preserving features
- Writing Noir circuits
- Optimizing proof generation
- Integrating proofs with Solana programs

## Key Principles

1. **Minimize Constraints**: Fewer constraints = faster proofs
2. **Privacy by Design**: Consider what should be hidden
3. **Verifiable Correctness**: Ensure circuits prove what's needed
4. **Gas Awareness**: Optimize for on-chain verification cost
